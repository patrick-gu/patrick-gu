# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick! I'm a secondary school student from Kamloops, Canada.

Currently, I'm working on various projects. Some of the languages I use are Rust, JavaScript and Typescript, C++, Python, Java and Kotlin, and x86 assembly.

I enjoy learning about computers and math, and hope to continue studying programming in the future.
